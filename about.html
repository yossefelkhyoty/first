                    <p>The Premier League is the organising body of the Premier League with responsibility for the
                        competition, its Rule Book and the centralised broadcast and other commercial rights.</p>
                    <p>We work proactively and constructively with our Member Clubs and the other football authorities
                        to improve the quality of football, both in England and across the world.</p>
                    <h4>The Premier League is all about the football</h4>
                    <p>Watching fantastic players and exciting matches creates the support that drives the broadcast and
                        the commercial interest that ensures we can re-invest in the game, both domestically and
                        globally.</p>
                    <h4>The best football</h4>
                    <p>The principal objective of the Premier League is to stage the most competitive and compelling
                        league with world-class players and, through the equitable distribution of broadcast and
                        commercial revenues, to enable clubs to develop so that European competition is a realistic aim
                        and, once there, they are playing at a level where they can compete effectively.</p>
                    <p>Many of the most famous clubs in world football play in the Premier League and, thanks to our
                        distribution model, which is the most equitable in top-flight European football, the League is
                        incredibly competitive, unpredictable and exciting.</p>
                    <p>In recent seasons, the battles for the title, UEFA Champions League places and to avoid
                        relegation have been the tightest and hardest fought on record.</p>
                    <p>Some of the biggest names in world football play in the Premier League every week: from Harry
                        Kane to Erling Haaland, Mohamed Salah to Martin Odegaard, David De Gea to Virgil van Dijk. The
                        world’s best players come to England to play in a compelling league competition, in front of
                        passionate full houses and matches that are seen all over the world.</p>
                    <p>The global stars attracted to the Premier League help raise the playing standards of young
                        English talent such as Phil Foden, Bukayo Saka, Jordan Pickford, Trent Alexander-Arnold and
                        Marcus Rashford.</p>
                    <p>Our clubs are producing excellent players, who take their place alongside the international
                        superstars on merit.</p>
                    <h4>Global phenomenon</h4>
                    <p>The Premier League is the world’s league. It has become a global phenomenon, inspiring passion
                        and emotion from Los Angeles to Lagos, from Macau to Melbourne.</p>
                    <p>It has become a league of nations on the pitch, too. In 1992 there were only 11 non-British or
                        Irish footballers in the Premier League. These days there are, on average, about 70
                        nationalities running on to the pitch in the Premier League.</p>
                    <p>A strong domestic league has been beneficial in Europe, too. When the Premier League was formed
                        in 1992, England was 13th in the UEFA Association Coefficient table. A decade later it had risen
                        to third, the Premier League behind La Liga and Serie A, who between them were in the middle of
                        a 16-year period at the top of European football.</p>
                    <p>Since then, the Premier League has been in the top three of the Coefficient standings with strong
                        performances in Europe from established UEFA performers.</p>
                    <p>Central to the continued progress of the Premier League, and the wider English game, is
                        the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.premierleague.com/youth/EPPP">Elite Player Performance
                            Plan</a>&nbsp;(EPPP), which was produced by the Premier League after consulting
                        representatives of the Football League and The FA.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>The EPPP is a long-term plan that promotes the development of a world-leading Academy system,
                        with the aim of producing more, and better, Home Grown Players.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>The Premier League and its Clubs are committed to generating domestic talent, with more than 95
                        per cent of young players in training being British.</p>
                    <p>It will be this talent, developed through the EPPP, which will see some of the best prepared
                        world-class players taking part in what will be most competitive and compelling league in
                        football.</p>
